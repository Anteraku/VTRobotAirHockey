This folder is used to test C# complier mono. If using Ubuntu for C# projects,
I would recommend the mono compiler. The download instructions can be found
here, http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin. The files included were made from following this instruction set
found here, http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/.
